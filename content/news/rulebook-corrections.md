We have noticed some grammatical errors that required corrections in the rulebook, so we have updated the rulebook.

In addition, we have added a section in the rulebook regarding CC licenses, to prevent copyright abuse from the videos that have been submitted to this tournament.

We plan to release the submitted videos online on our website to encourage individuals to use the videos to make promotional videos. We hope for your understanding.
