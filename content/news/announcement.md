We are pleased to announce that Pen Spinning World Tournament will be happening this year 2021.

This yearâ€™s tournament will be organized by the _Pen Spinning Board of Directors (PBoD)_, a group of spinners who are experienced in organizing international events.

We are excited to see the amount of interest coming to world tournament, and the rising skill of individual spinners. PBoD would like to offer a stage for spinners with ambition to show off what they think they are capable of and put our full efforts in delivering a good quality tournament.
